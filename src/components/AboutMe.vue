				Hi ! I am Adrien Leveque, I am 19 years old and I am in the second year of BUT MMI. I have always liked to try lots of different things. I'm super curious and I love discovering new things. This is why I chose MMI. It covers a little bit of everything in multimedia and the Internet, which really allows me to flourish. <br> <br>

I like learning new techniques and taking on challenges. In addition to technical skills, I think teamwork and creativity are important. I am open to new ideas and strive to collaborate effectively with others. <br> <br>

On this site you will be able to see what I have done so far. If you are looking for someone motivated and ready to invest in their projects, do not hesitate to contact me!

Thank you for taking the time to stop by here. See you soon maybe !
